`./DataUnshared/` Directory
=========
Files inthis directory are stored locally, but not staged/committed and sent to the central GitHub repository.  A line in `./.gitignore/` keeps the files uncommitted/unstaged.

Even though these files are kept off the central repository, it still should not contain anything sensitive enough that it requires encryption when stored on your local drive (such as PHI).
